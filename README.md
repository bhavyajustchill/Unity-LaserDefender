This is my fifth Unity 2D game. It is essentially a clone of Space Invaders game!

- You have to defend your planet from invaders
- Both your ship and Enemy Ships can fire Lasers at one another!
- The more you shoot, the more your score goes up!
- Infinite Enemies, so see how much further you can go!

## Screenshots Coming Soon...
